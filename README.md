# Testgen

##About
This is meant to be a tool for generating basic math tests. Currently, I'm developing it for simple algebra problems, but more advanced material may be added in the future. Additionally, this software will be able to construct accompanying answer keys as well as generate truly random, or individualized tests.

##Bugs and Future Features
1.  Generate x in a different location within a problem (e.g. "a + bx = c", or "a + b = cx")
2.  Generate negative coefficients and values for a, b, c, and x
3.  Find a way to determine if two problems are the same, even if they are ordered differently.
4.  Implement random generation of test problems
